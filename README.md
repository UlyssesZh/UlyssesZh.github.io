Install [pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref)
and [pandoc-katex](https://github.com/xu-cheng/pandoc-katex) (make their executables available in PATH)
(alternatively, if you have Cabal and Cargo installed, run `rake prepare`).

Then, run

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Development
