I, the president and one of the founders of Little Turings,
created a [website](https://littleturings.github.io){:target="_blank"}
to distribute information about it.
The website is bilingual (Chinese and English).

The website is currently incomplete.
Some information is still at ulysseszh.github.io.
I will gradually transfer it into the new site in the future.

If you are interested to be with us, you can follow
[these instructions](https://littleturings.github.io/m/add-yourself.html){:target="_blank"}.
