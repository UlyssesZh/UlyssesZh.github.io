excerpt: 'The aliens intiated their attack to the earth!
They shoot bullets with mass $m$ and speed $v$ from a far-awar planet.
To defend, humans built a field $U=\alpha/r$ that can repel the bullets.
What regions are safe?
The answer turns out to be the interior of a circular paraboloid.'

Every possible trajectory of the bullet is parameterized by $b$, the impact parameter.
The bullet has energy $E=\frac12mv^2$ and angular momentum $M=mvb$,
which are conserved.
According to the well-known results of Kepler problem,
the trajectory is a hyperbola

$$-\frac pr=1+e\cos\varphi,$$

where

$$p\coloneqq\frac{M^2}{m\alpha},\quad e\coloneqq\sqrt{1+\frac{2EM^2}{m\alpha^2}}.$$

For convenience, denote the radius of the hyperbola as

$$a\coloneqq\frac\alpha{2E},$$

then we can write the equation of the trajectory as

$$-\frac{b^2}{ar}=1+\sqrt{1+\frac{b^2}{a^2}}\cos\varphi.$$

Rotate the trajectory so that the incident direction is always towards the positive $x$ direction:

$$0=F\!\left(r,\varphi,b\right)\coloneqq\frac{b^2}{ar}+1+\cos\varphi+\frac ba\sin\varphi.$$ {#eq:eq-trajectory}

To find the envelope of the family of trajectories, solve

$$0=\frac{\partial F}{\partial b}=\frac{2b}{ar}+a\sin\varphi,$$

and we have

$$b=-\frac12r\sin\varphi.$$

Substitute back into Equation [@eq:eq-trajectory], and we have finally the equation of the envelope:

$$\frac{4a}r=1-\cos\varphi,$$

which is a parabola with the the semi-latus rectum being $4a$.
Therefore, the safe regions are the interior of a circular paraboloid.
