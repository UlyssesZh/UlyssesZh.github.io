Consider the function $y=f\left(\mathbf x\right)$, where the domain
$D\subseteq\mathbb R^n$, and the function is differentiable
everywhere.

According to some well-known theories, we can derive that
the normal vector of the graph of the function at
$\left(\mathbf x_0,f\left(\mathbf x_0\right)\right)$ is
$\left(\nabla f\left(\mathbf x_0\right),-1\right)$.

This gives us an idea that, in fact a conservative field
consists of normal vectors of its potential function
(a scalar function).

We also know that a scalar function can be derived from
its gradient by integrating it along an arbitrary path
(what exactly the path is is not important because it is a
conservative field, so you can choose one as long as it can
make the calculation easy). Here it can come into our minds that
we can derive a multi-variable function from its normal vectors.

The method is to make the last component of the normal vectors
be $-1$ and then calculate the integral of the rest components.

I am sorry that the passage is too brief, but I need to have some
rest after experiencing several continuous tests
today and yesterday. Bless me!
