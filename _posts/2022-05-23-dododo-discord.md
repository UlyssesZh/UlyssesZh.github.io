I have created a [community rhythm game called Dododo](https://dododogame.github.io).
It is a rhythm game with musical rhythm notations.

It is an open-source project, whose source codes can be seen in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dododogame/dododo).

It is not mature currently.
To help Dododo become mature, I wish you could join our community by [joining our Discord server](https://discord.gg/yYdMw5hm2K):
