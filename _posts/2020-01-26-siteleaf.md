I have been using [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/){target="_blank"}
to manage my blog. It is just convenient and amazing.

If you own your own website, Siteleaf is perfect for managing it.
It supports Jekyll and GitHub pages, and is free for developers.
The only disadvantage is that its built-in Markdown editor does not
support real-time $\LaTeX$ preview.

(In fact, I use RubyMine as my editor because it is a powerful Ruby IDE
and there is VCS and terminals integrated.)

By the way, I apologize for my poor English.
