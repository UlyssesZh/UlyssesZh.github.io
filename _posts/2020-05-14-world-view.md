excerpt: 'The view of the world... Physically!
In this article, I tried to use mathematical language to describe models of the physical world.
A view of the world should include:
a space (actually spacetime) with some mathematical structure on it (whose points are events in the world),
a symmetry principle describing the symmetry of the world,
and a motion law to describe the physics and dynamics of the world.
This article proposed models for Galilean, Einsteinian, and even Aristotelian worlds.
Can you come up with even other worlds?'

## Introduction

Have you ever thought of how can we describe the basic
principles of our world (or universe), especially
in a physical or mathematical way?

The thought itself seems like a philosophical problem
(and is actually thought over by philosophers for thousands
of years). However, maybe it can be interesting to think
it over in another perspective.

Note that most of the definitions used below are different
from the popular definitions!

## Galilean world

Here is the basic principle of the Galilean world:
> Principle 1: The world is a Galilean structure with
> $3$-dimensional space and $1$-dimensional time.

Here is the definition of a Galilean structure.
A *Galilean structure* with $\chi$-dimensional space
and $\iota$-dimensional time is a $3$-tuple
$\left(\mathscr A,\tau,\rho\right)$ with the following
principles:
1. $\mathscr A$ is a $\nu$-dimensional
affine space associated with the vector space $\mathbb R^\nu$,
where $\nu:=\chi+\iota$;
2. $\tau:\mathbb R^\nu\rightarrow\mathbb R^\iota$
is a linear mapping;
3. For $a,b\in\mathscr A$ such that $\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=0$,
the mapping $\rho$ satisfies
$\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)=\sqrt{\left(a-b\right)^2}$.

To make the physical meanings of the above mathematical stuff
clear, we
- call $\mathscr A$ the *universe* or a *Galilean space*,
- call the points in the universe the *events*,
- call $\tau$ the *time*,
- say two events $a,b$ are *simultaneous*
iff $\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=0$,
- call $\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)$ the
*distance between simultaneous events $a,b$*.

---
Here is the second principle of the Galilean world:
> Principle 2 (Galileo's principle of relativity):
> Laws of nature remain the same under Galilean transformation.

Here is the definition of a Galilean transformation.
An affine transformation $g$ over the Galilean space $\mathscr A$
is called a *Galilean transformation*
iff both of the following are satisfied:
1. $\forall a,b\in\mathscr A:
\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=\tau\\!\left(ga-gb\right)$
(preservation of intervals of time),
2. $\forall a,b\in\mathscr A:
\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=0\Rightarrow
\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)=\rho\\!\left(ga,gb\right)$
(preservation of distance between simultaneous events).

Galilean transformations form a group (why?) called
the *Galilean group*, which is an
$\left(\iota+\frac{\chi\left(\chi+3\right)}2\right)$-dimensional
Lie group (why?).

---

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathscr A&:=\mathbb R^\nu,\\
\tau&:=\left(t,x\right)\mapsto t,\\
\rho&:=\left(a,b\right)\mapsto\sqrt{\left(a-b\right)^2}
\end{align*}
$$

is a Galilean structure (why?).
Here $\mathscr A$ is called the *Galilean coordinate space*.

The following transformations on the Galilean coordinate space
are Galilean transformations (why?):
1. $\left(t,x\right)\mapsto\left(t,x+vt\right)$,
where $v\in\mathbb R^\chi$ (*uniform motion*),
2. $\left(t,x\right)\mapsto\left(t+s,x+d\right)$,
where $s\in\mathbb R^\iota$ and $d\in\mathbb R^\chi$
(*translation*),
3. $\left(t,x\right)\mapsto\left(t,Gx\right)$,
where $G\in\mathrm O\left(\chi\right)$
(*rotation*).

Every Galilean transformation of the Galilean coordinate space
can be represented uniquely as the composition of a rotation,
a translation, and a uniform motion (why?).

All Galilean spaces with the same dimensions
are isomorphic to each other (why?).

---
In fact, the two principles above are not enough to
build up the whole classical mechanics.
We need to define motion, velocity, and acceleration
in our $3$-$1$ universe, and use the third principle
> Principle 3 (Newton's principle of determinacy):
> The motion is uniquely determined by initial positions
> and initial velocities.

to conclude that the motion can be depicted by
*Hamilton's principle*

$$
    \delta\int\mathcal L\!\left(q,\dot q,t\right)=0
$$

(why?), which leads to *Euler--Lagrange equation*

$$
    \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt}
    \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\dot q}=
    \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial q}
$$

(why?).

According to Principle 2, for a closed system,
its Euler--Lagrange equation should
remain unchanged after a Galilean transformation
(in a specific coordinate system, which in most cases is
the Cartesian coordinate system utilized by
Galilean coordinate space) acts on it,
from which we can see that the universe is
*time-homogeneous* (invariance under time translation),
*space-homogeneous* (invariance under space translation),
and *space-isotropic* (invariance under space rotation).

The rest
(deriving the *Lagrangian* for some typical mechanical systems,
and solving them) is just the normal classical mechanics,
and is not related to the topic today.

## Einsteinian world

We can build up the Einsteinian world similarly as we have
done for the Galilean world.
> Principle 1: The world is an Einsteinian structure
> with $3$-dimensional space and $1$-dimensional time.

Here is the definition of an Einsteinian structure.
An *Einsteinian structure* with $\chi$-dimensional space
and $\iota$-dimensional time is a $4$-tuple
$\left(\mathscr A,\tau,\sigma,\rho\right)$
with the following principles:
1. $\mathscr A$ is a $\nu$-dimensional affine space
associated with the vector space $\mathbb R^\nu$,
where $\nu:=\chi+\iota$;
2. $\tau:\mathbb R^\nu\rightarrow\mathbb R^\iota$
and $\sigma:\mathbb R^\nu\rightarrow\mathbb R^\chi$
are linear mappings;
3. The linear mapping $a\mapsto\left(\tau\\!\left(a\right),
\sigma\\!\left(a\right)\right):
\mathbb R^\nu\rightarrow\mathbb R^\nu$ has full rank;
4. $\forall a,b\in\mathscr A:\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)=
\sqrt{\tau\left(a-b\right)^2-\sigma\left(a-b\right)^2}$.

To make the physical meanings of the above mathematical
stuff clear, we
- call $\mathscr A$ the *universe* or an *Einsteinian space*,
- call the points in the universe the *events*,
- call $\tau$ the *time*,
- call $\sigma$ the *space*,
- call $\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)$ the
*spacetime interval between events $a,b$*.

Here is the second principle of the Einsteinian world:
> Principle 2 (Einstein's principle of relativity):
> Laws of nature remain the same under
> extended Poincaré transformation.

Here is the definition of a Poincaré transformation.
An affine transformation $g$ over the Einsteinian space
$\mathscr A$ is called a *Poincaré transformation*
iff $\forall a,b\in\mathscr A:
\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)=\rho\\!\left(ga,gb\right)$.
Well, the definition is much simpler than that of
Galilean transformation.

Poincaré transformations form a group (why?)
called the *Poincaré group*, which is a
$\frac{\nu\left(\nu+1\right)}2$-dimensional Lie group (why?).

---

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathscr A&:=\mathbb R^\nu,\\
    \tau&:=\left(ct,x\right)\mapsto t,\\
    \sigma&:=\left(ct,x\right)\mapsto x,\\
    \rho&:=\left(a,b\right)\mapsto
    \sqrt{\tau\!\left(a-b\right)^2-\sigma\!\left(a-b\right)^2}
\end{align*}
$$

is an Einsteinian structure (why?), where the constant
$c\in\mathbb R$ is called the *speed of light*.
Here $\mathscr A$ is called the *Minkowski space*.

The following transformations on the Minkowski space are
Poincaré transformations (why?):
1. $a\mapsto a+d$, where $d\in\mathbb R^\nu$ (*translation*),
2. $a\mapsto Ga$, where $G\in\mathrm O\\!\left(\iota,\chi\right)$
is an indefinite orthogonal matrix (*rotation*).

Every Poincaré transformation of the Minkowski space can be
represented uniquely as the composition of a translation
and a rotation (why?).

All Einsteinian spaces with the same dimensions are isomorphic
to each other (why?).

---
The rest is just the same as what we have done with
Galilean world.
You can find that the Einsteinian world is also
space-homogeneous, time-homogeneous, and space-isotropic.
Further more, it is time-isotropic.

## Aristotelian world (imagination)

Although the Aristotelian world is not real, we can
think of what it may look like.
> Principle 1: The world is an Aristotelian structure
> with $3$-dimensional space and $1$-dimensional time.

According to Aristotle's theory about the natural place,
the world has something like a "center",
so the world cannot be space-homogeneous.
However, he admits the invariance of natural laws over time,
so the world is still time-homogeneous.
It may be also reasonable to assume that
the world is space-isotropic.

Thus, our definition of the Aristotelian structure
should be non-affine, and the Aristotelian transformations
should be composed of rotation and time translation.

However, although the space is non-affine, the time is affine.
This makes it tricky to mix space and time together into
an "$\mathscr A$".
However, there is a workaround. We can define the universe
still an affine space, while give it an origin.
Since this origin only add limitations to space transformation
instead of time transformation, we can make it
an $\iota$-dimensional affine subspace instead of a single point.

Here is the definition of an Aristotelian structure.
An *Aristotelian structure* with $\chi$-dimensional
space and $\iota$-dimensional time is a $4$-tuple
$\left(\mathscr A,\tau,o,\rho\right)$ with the following
principles:
1. $\mathscr A$ is a $\nu$-dimensional affine space
associated with the vector space $\mathbb R^\nu$,
where $\nu:=\chi+\iota$;
2. $\tau:\mathbb R^\nu\rightarrow\mathbb R^\iota$
is a linear mapping;
3. $o$ is an $\iota$-dimensional affine subspace of $\mathscr A$;
4. For $a,b\in\mathscr A$ such that $\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=0$,
the mapping $\rho$ satisfies $\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)=
\sqrt{\left(a-b\right)^2}$.

To make the physical meanings of the above mathematical stuff
clear, we
- call $\mathscr A$ the *universe* or an *Aristotelian space*,
- call the points in the universe the *events*,
- call $\tau$ the *time*,
- call $o$ the *center* of space,
- say two events $a,b$ are *simultaneous*
iff $\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=0$,
- call $\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)$ the
*distance between simultaneous events $a,b$*.

---
Then the task is to define the Aristotelian transformations.
> Principle 2: Laws of nature remain the same under
> Aristotelian transformation.

Here is the definition of an Aristotelian transformation.
An affine transformation $g$ over the Aristotelian space
$\mathscr A$ is called an *Aristotelian transformation*
iff all of the following are satisfied:
1. $\forall a,b\in\mathscr A:
\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=\tau\\!\left(ga-gb\right)$,
2. $\forall a,b\in\mathscr A:
\tau\\!\left(a-b\right)=0\Rightarrow
\rho\\!\left(a,b\right)=\rho\\!\left(ga,gb\right)$.
3. $\forall a\in o:ga\in o$.

Notice the third condition, which makes it different from
a Galilean transformation.

Aristotelian transformations from a group (why?) called
the *Aristotelian group*, which is an
$\left(\iota+\frac{\chi\left(\chi-1\right)}2\right)$-dimensional
Lie group (why?).

---

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathscr A&:=\mathbb R^\nu,\\
    \tau&:=\left(t,x\right)\mapsto t,\\
    o&:=\mathbb R^\iota\times\left\{0\right\},\\
    \rho&:=\left(a,b\right)\mapsto\sqrt{\left(a-b\right)^2}
\end{align*}
$$

is an Aristotelian structure (why?). Here $\mathscr A$
is called the *Aristotelian coordinate space*.

The following transformations on the Aristotelian coordinate
space are Aristotelian transformations (why?):
1. $\left(t,x\right)\mapsto\left(t+s,x\right)$,
where $s\in\mathbb R^\iota$ (*time translation*),
2. $\left(t,x\right)\mapsto\left(t,Gx\right)$,
where $G\in\mathrm O\\!\left(\chi\right)$ (*rotation*).

Every Aristotelian transformation of the Aristotelian
coordinate space can be represented uniquely as
the composition of a time translation and a rotation (why?).

All Aristotelian spaces with the same dimensions are isomorphic
to each other (why?).

---
After building up the Aristotle world, how can we develop
the mechanics here?
Maybe it can be interesting.

## Other imaginations

Here are some other imaginations of a world:
- What about a space-anistropic universe?
- What about defining the spacetime interval by
multiplying space interval and time interval?
- What about a time-heterogeneous universe?
- What about making laws of nature unchanged
under uniform acceleration?
- What about...

These can be materials for science fiction
(novels or video games).
