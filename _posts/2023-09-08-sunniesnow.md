Lyrica is one of my favorite mobile rhythm games.
However, because of the lack of popularity, the player community is not very active.
In order to build a better player community for Lyrica, I did the following things:

- I created a [Fandom Wiki for Lyrica](https://lyrica.fandom.com/zh-tw/wiki/).
- I created a [subreddit for Lyrica](https://reddit.com/r/lyricagame/).
- I created an [unofficial Discord server for Lyrica](https://discord.gg/6ZHRU9teju).

Besides these, most importantly, in order to build a custom charting community for Lyrica,
I created a new rhythm game called [Sunniesnow](https://sunniesnow.github.io).
It is a rhythm game similar to Lyrica.
Any people can write their own charts for Sunniesnow, serving as fanmade charts for Lyrica.

(this is also the unofficial Discord server for Lyrica I created).
