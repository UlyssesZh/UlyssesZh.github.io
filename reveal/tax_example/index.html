	<h2>Pigovian tax</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>Pigovian tax</b> is a tax on any market activity that generates negative externalities.

			Fat tax is a kind of Pigovian tax,
			so before we talk about fat tax,
			we need to know what is Pigovian tax to make better sense about fat tax later.
		</p>
		<p>
			A Pigovian tax is a tax on any market activity that generates negative externalities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Externality means the costs not included in the market price.
			In other words, it affects a third party who did not expect to have that cost.
		</p>
		<p>
			The diagram illustrates the working of a Pigovian tax.
			A tax shifts the marginal private cost curve up by the amount of the externality.

	<h2>Fat tax</h2>
	<p>
		A <b>fat tax</b> is a tax or surcharge that is placed upon fattening food, beverages or on overweight individuals.

			Fat tax is a practical example of Pigovian tax.
			It is a tax or surcharge that is placed upon fattening food, beverages or on overweight individuals.
		</p>
		<p>
			A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity,
			which is the externality we want to use it to reduce.
			It can reduce the consumption of foods that are high in saturated fat, such as fast food.

	<h2>Mechanism</h2>
	<p>
		Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.

			Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.
			In fact, eating behavior may be more responsive to price increases than to nutritional education.
			Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.

	<h2>Effects</h2>
	<section>
		<p>
			Effects on public health
		</p>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				Effects on public health:
			</p>
			<p>
				(1) Taxing only the principal sources of dietary saturated fat is unlikely to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease because the reduction in saturated fat is offset by a rise in salt consumption.
			</p>
			<p>
				(2) Taxing unhealthy foods, defined by SSCg3d score, might avert around 2300 deaths per annum, primarily by reducing salt intake.
			</p>
			<p>
				(3) Taxing a wider range of foods could avert up to 3200 cardiovascular deaths in the UK per annum (a 1.7% reduction).
			</p>
			<p>
				Taxing foodstuffs can have unpredictable health effects if cross-elasticities of demand are ignored.
				A carefully targeted fat tax could produce modest but meaningful changes in food consumption and a reduction in cardiovascular disease.

				The American Beverage Association, the industry lobby for makers of nonalcoholic beverages, denounced the proposal.
				"This is purely a money grab that would be paid for by hard-working New York
				families," the association said, warning that the move could jeopardize jobs.
				The group said the beverage industry accounts for 160,000 jobs that generate $6.7 billion in wages in New York State each year.

			Effects on marketing
		</p>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				Effects on marketing:
			</p>
			<p>
				Economists agree that government intervention in a market is warranted when there are market failures that result in less than optimal production and consumption.
				Several market failures exist for sugar-sweetened beverages.
				First, many persons make consumption decisions with imperfect information, failing to fully appreciate the links between consumption and health consequences.
				These decisions are likely to be further distorted by the extensive marketing that can raise the perceived benefits of consumption.
				A second failure results from time-inconsistent preferences (decisions that provide short-term gratification but long-term harm).
				This problem is exacerbated for children and adolescents who place a higher value on present satisfaction while more heavily discounting future consequences.
				So if government set up the fat tax, it may help to solve these market fails.

				Effects on governments:
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, financial externalities exist in the market for SSBs &mdash; consumers do not bear the full costs of their consumption decisions.
				Given the contribution of SSB consumption to obesity as well as the health consequences independent of weight, SSB consumption generates excess health care costs.
				Medical costs for overweight and obesity alone are estimated to be 9.1% of U.S. health care expenditures ($147 billion), with half of these paid for publicly through Medicare and Medicaid.
				In conclusion, governments can reduce the spending on health cares by raising those fat taxes.

	<h2>Problems</h2>

	<section>
		<p>
			The mechanism may not work as expected.
		</p>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				However, there can also be some problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first problem is that the mechanism may not work as expected.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although people will buy less food as the price of it increases,
				there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals,
				which means the obese individuals, the targeted people, contribute less to the purpose of diminishing obesity.
			</p>
			<p>
				It may be because to obese individuals, as their demand of food is larger, the price elasticity of demand is smaller.

	<section>
		<p>
			What products should be targeted?
		</p>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				Another problem is about what products fat tax should target.
				This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.
			</p>
			<p>
				For instance, saturated fat and salt are substitutes.
				Consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake,
				thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another reason for us to choose food carefully is that there are in fact not much studies about what food has strong association with obesity.
				Current proposals frequently single out sugar-sweetened drinks as a target for taxation.
				Cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental studies have found an association between obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks.
				However, experimental studies have not always found an association, and the size of the effect can be very modest.

		<p>
			Fat tax can be burdensome for the poor.
		</p>
		<aside class="notes">
			<p>
				Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be regressive.
				Taxing foods that provide primarily calories, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem,
				since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations.
			</p>
			<p>
				To make a fat tax less burdensome for the poor, proponents recommend earmarking the revenues to subsidize healthy foods and health education.
				Additionally, proponents have argued that the fat tax is less regressive
				to the extent that it lowers medical expenditures and expenditures on the targeted foods among the poor.
			</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, there is a higher incidence of diet-related illnesses among the poor than in the general population.
