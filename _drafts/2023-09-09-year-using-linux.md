excerpt: 'Since April 2022, I have been using Linux as my daily driver.
I have been using Linux for over a year now.
This article is a summary of my experience of using Linux.
Overall, I would like to say that it is rather satisfactory and
that I will continue to use Linux as my daily driver in future.'
