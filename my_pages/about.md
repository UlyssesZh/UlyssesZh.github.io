Here is the blog written by me,
UlyssesZhan (pronunciation: [juːˈlɪsiːzˈʈ͡ʂán]),
a.k.a. 有丘直方 (pronunciation: [jou̯˨˩˨t͡ɕʰjou̯˥ʈ͡ʂʐ̩˨˥faŋ˥]).
I share interesting thoughts of mine here.

Some of my basic (and improbably changing) information:

- Gender: **male**;
sex: **male**;
orientation: **heterosexual**;
pronouns: **he/him/his**.
- Birthday: **2003-09-07T10:41+08:00**.
- Nationality: **Chinese**.
- Hometown: **Shanghai**.

I am interested in physics, programming, and mathematics.
I am also interested in other academic fields such as economics, linguistics, etc.
although I have not studied them seriously.
For games, I play rhythm games, puzzle games, and PvZ series games.
I am a video creator about those games on video platforms.
I am happy if you want to [talk with me](/contact)
about those topics that I am interested in.

This blog may be updated at an extremely low frequency because
I may be busy.
If you want to prompt me to update my blog
(which is a really rare occasion), [contact me](/contact).
I will be happy if I know there are people interested in my blog!

Feel free to turn off JavaScript in your browser!
Equations (such as Equation [@eq:least-action] shown below)
can be rendered nicely without JavaScript.
The only broken things would be comments, search engine,
and (maybe disgusting) trackings.

Finally, I would like to tell you what I think is the most beautiful
equations of all.
Yes, it is Hamilton's principle
$$\delta\int\mathcal L\,\mathrm dt=0.$$ {#eq:least-action}

I will never tell you that I was actually to test whether
mathematical equations can be rendered correctly.
